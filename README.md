# LinkedIn_request_accept_all
We would have saved a lot of time if LinkedIn would have an Accept All button.
But instead of just addressing the problem, I thought why not write some code for it. 
## Steps to Follow
1. Just press F12 or right-click and click on Inspect.
2. Click on Console.
3. Copy this code and hit enter. (Code on GitHub)
4. All the requests are being accepted!
